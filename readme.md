# Hello, here is my repository where I practice tests automation with cypress.js and git. 
# I practice automation using 'http://automationpractice.com/' - it is an e-commerce demo site. 
# In 'page objects' folder there's a file login.js, where I store POM used in my tests, but mainly those are objects related to login functionality. 
# fillFormAndLogin_spec.js contains of two tests - first is commented, to use it you should enter your own email and uncomment it. Second test is simply login using valid credentials. 
# shopingCart_spec.js file contains simple code that will check adding two items into the shoping cart and then remove one, but after each step assertion is done - so we can check if our results are correct.
